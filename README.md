# RingNull Template

## About This Template

I created this template for myself, to use in my videos and for my own needs. 

 This theme combines elements from the IIIT-Hyderabad, Statale and Focus themes with some custom additions. 

 Contributions:
 - Statale theme adapted by Srikar Sharma Sadhu (srikar.sadhu@research.iiit.ac.in) for IIIT-Hyderabad
 - Giorgio Marchetti (ciao@gio.im) for Statale presentations. 
 - Original template by Federico Zenith (federico.zenith@sintef.no)
 		derived from HÃ¥vard Berland's beamerthementnu class.
 - Focus theme by Pasquale Claudio Africa (2018) and Sebastian Friedl (2018).

# Features

- Four different color themes, which can be switched with an optional argument to the theme, `red`, `blue`, `purple` and `green`
- A footline that isn't just a number, but is instead a bar that fills from left to right. 
- Full and automatic bibliography support included in `\backmatter`
- A `headless` frame option to produce frames without title slides.
- Multiple `tcblistings` enviroments using minted to produce beautiful source code slides.
- An optional watermark.
